Game of Life with SDL in C. First year C Sci project. 

You need to download and install SDL to build this project. There is a lazy foo tutorial link at the top of the
comments in "main.c" file. I was forced to use dev cpp with this project. 

Do what ever you like with this project. It has already been handed in.
